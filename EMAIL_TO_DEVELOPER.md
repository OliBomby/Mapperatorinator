**Subject:** Pull Request: Queue System & Workflow Enhancements for Mapperatorinator

---

Hi Olivier,

I wanted to reach out about a pull request I've submitted for Mapperatorinator.

First, thank you for creating this project—it's been an absolute game-changer for exploring AI-assisted beatmap generation. What started as me fixing a few bugs turned into a much larger passion project.

**What I've added:**
- Multi-map queue system with batch processing
- Audio fingerprinting (AcoustID + Shazam) for auto-detecting songs
- Mapper style sampling via osu! API v2
- Preview time picker with full audio player
- Background image support in .osz exports
- BF16 precision mode (~40-60% faster on RTX 30xx/40xx)
- Various bug fixes and QoL improvements

All changes are additive—nothing was removed or broken. I've merged the latest upstream and included a detailed CHANGELOG.md.

**PR:** https://github.com/OliBomby/Mapperatorinator/pull/[NUMBER]

I'd be honored if you'd consider reviewing it. Happy to discuss, adjust, or cherry-pick specific features if that works better.

Thanks for your time!

Best,
